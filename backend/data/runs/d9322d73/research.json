It provides hyper-local data including detailed routing (bus/train), sheltered walkways, property prices, school catchment areas (1km radius), and land ownership information that global competitors often miss.",

    "trend": "Hyper-local 'Life Hacks' and 'Hidden Features'",
    "insight": "While Google Maps dominates general navigation, users are increasingly frustrated by its lack of local nuance (e.g., covered walkways during rain, exact HDB block numbers, or official school distances). The viral opportunity lies in positioning OneMap not just as a map, but as a 'Cheat Code' for living in Singapore."
