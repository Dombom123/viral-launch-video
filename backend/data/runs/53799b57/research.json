    "trend": "The 'Local Cheat Code' Trend. Social media users are currently obsessed with apps and tools that give them an unfair advantage in daily life\u2014whether it's finding the cheapest rent, the driest route during rain, or the fastest bus.",
    "insight": "While global competitors like Google Maps dominate general navigation, they lack granular local data (like specific property prices or sheltered walkways). The viral opportunity lies in positioning OneMap not just as a map, but as a 'Super App' for smart living and property intelligence."
