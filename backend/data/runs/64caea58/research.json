    "description": "An all-in-one authoritative digital map application that goes beyond standard navigation. It likely features specialized geospatial data such as property transaction prices, school catchment area radius queries, sheltered walking routes, and detailed public transport integration. It serves as a 'life hack' tool for urban residents.",

    "insight": "Users are fatigued by standard navigation apps that only show routes. The current viral opportunity lies in 'Information Asymmetry'\u2014showing users data they didn't know was publicly accessible (like exact property prices of neighbors or precise school distances). Positioning the app not as a map, but as a 'Cheat Sheet for City Living,' drives higher save rates and shares."
