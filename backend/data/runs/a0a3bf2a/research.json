    "trend": "The 'Return to Office' Friction vs. The Hybrid Lifestyle",
    "insight": "Employees are currently resisting RTO mandates due to the inconvenience. The viral angle isn't 'efficiency' for the company, but 'convenience' and 'wellness' for the user. Framing the app as a tool that guarantees a good seat, fresh air, and zero stress makes the office feel like a high-end coworking space rather than a cubicle farm."
