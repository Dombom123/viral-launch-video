    "description": "An authoritative, hyper-local mapping and navigation application (likely based on the Singapore Land Authority's OneMap). It goes beyond basic navigation by providing granular geospatial data, including precise property transaction prices, school catchment areas (1km radius), sheltered walkways, and detailed public transit integration.",

    "trend": "The 'Hidden Utility' & 'Local Life Hacks' Trend",
    "insight": "Social media users are currently fatigued by generic lifestyle content and crave 'high-utility' tools that give them an information advantage. While global giants like Google Maps dominate navigation, they lack granular local context (e.g., covered walkways for rain, exact land ownership, or school eligibility). Positioning OneMap not just as a map, but as a 'Data Superpower' for real estate and daily commuting, taps into the viral desire for 'insider knowledge.'"
