        "premise": "The video visualizes the lonely, chaotic struggle of creativity. We follow a frantic screenwriter who is overwhelmed by ideas until he uses aiCanto.

        "role": "Rusty represents the user's pain point. He interacts with the software not just by typing, but by physically gesturing to the holographic projections of the aiCanto agents.",
